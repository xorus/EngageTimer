  Finally, display all the numbers when starting a countdown!
  Comes with an accurate pull timer that starts when you or any of your party members enter combat.

  Features :
  - Big countdown that displays all the numbers
  - Customizable big-number textures (default, yellow, WoW style or custom files)
  - Display combat time in the Server Info Bar, and/or a floating window
  - OBS browser-source compatible page with countdown and current combat duration

  Why the OBS thing ? Well, it can be useful if you want a big stylized stopwatch in your recordings.
  See repository for more info.
