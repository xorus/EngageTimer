This is a plugin for the [FFXIV plugin platform Dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

The original motivation for this plugin was to do something like
["Acurate Countdown" plugin by Haplo064](https://github.com/Haplo064/Europe)
but with a big stopwatch timer for my recordings.

*Living on the edge ? You can add my testing repository : https://xorus.dev/xiv/*

## Countdown

Adds the missing numbers in the standard countdown thing!

![Countdown example](Doc/countdown.gif)

This examples showcases the bundled number styles with the hide original timer option enabled.

You can also enable the "ticking" sound if you want.

### Make your own number textures

Select `Custom` as Style in the settings for Big Countdown and set your own texture folder !

**Requirements:**

- Images must be PNG
- Files must be names from 0.png to 9.png
- Images can be any width
- Images will top-aligned, so I recommend using the same height for all numbers

## Stopwatch

![Stopwatch example](Doc/stopwatch.gif)

Super simple combat timer you can place anywhere on your screen with optional tenths of seconds for some kinds of nerds.
Kinda customizable.

It can also display countdowns in a more precise manner.

## OBS overlay

The plugin lets you enable a web server that can be used to display your current timer information in a more accurate
way.

Alternatively you can access this web page from another device and see the timer thing.

![Web page](Doc/overlay.png)

In OBS as a browser source :

![OBS Setup](Doc/OBS.png)

You can easily change the font by adding something like this in the *Custom CSS* in the OBS browser source settings:

```css
body {
    font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
}
```

The timer page was designed to be as simple as possible for easily overriding with custom styles in OBS. But I could
implement a way to customize it in the plugin GUI if someone needs that.

## Other things I need to say

I have based myself on the work of ["Acurate Countdown" plugin by Haplo064](https://github.com/Haplo064/Europe)
for the countdown pointer and on the [Peeping Tom plugin by asclemens](https://git.sr.ht/~jkcclemens/PeepingTom) for the
idea of using NAudio lib to play the sound.

Smooth font size was adapted from ["Ping Plugin" by karashiiro](https://github.com/karashiiro/PingPlugin)
